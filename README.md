# Numenera Character Concept Generator

I am slowly developing this simple program in order to learn how to create GUIs in Python and as a first of a series of generators for
RPG systems.

In the future I want to create executable files downloadable from the Internet, but for now in order to run it:
1. Clone the repository
2. Run the numenera_char_gen.py file in Terminal
